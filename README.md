# Resetter-cli

Easiest way to reset your debian based linux back to stock on the terminal. It is built using python and the python-curses library. This is targeted mostly at servers with no GUI but it can be easily be used on a desktop computer with a GUI.

# Status
This program is in alpha stage, no builds have been released yet. It is constantly being developed in order to be in working order.

[2018-02-20]
I had some time to work on this as I'm in week break from school. It is at least usable now for custom resetting. Again no builds have been made yet as I still need to test it on some distros other than Mint 18.3


# Features

Unlike its graphic counterpart, resetter-cli does not contain any extra features yet, only the main basics are available. More features will be added as the app matures in stability.
