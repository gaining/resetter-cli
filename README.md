# Resetter-cli 
Easiest way to reset your debian based linux back to stock on the terminal. It is built using python and the python-curses library. This is targeted mostly at servers with no GUI but it can be easily be used on a desktop computer with a GUI.

# Status
Totally dropped - will not continue development. 
Project is doable but there's no real case for doing this. Power users using servers do not need a tool such as this. Maintaining this would cost me a lot of time and I'm not receiving any funding at all for doing this or resetter. Therefore, I have no motivation to continue developing this. Others are welcome to fork and continue if they wish to.
