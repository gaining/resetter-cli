# Resetter-cli
Easiest way to reset your debian based linux back to stock on the terminal. It is built using python3 and the python-curses library. This is targeted mostly at servers with no GUI but it can be easily be used on a desktop computer with a GUI.

#Status
This program is in alpha stage, I've tested it and it works for me. I'm really looking for feedbacks and strongly urge you to provide feedback (bugs encountered, improvements, etc). Again, if you do not have a github account do not hesitate to contact me by email.

#Features
Unlike its graphic counterpart, resetter-cli does not contain any extra features yet, only the main basics are available. More features will be added as the app matures in stability.
